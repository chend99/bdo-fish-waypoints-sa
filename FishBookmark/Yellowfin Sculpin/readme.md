## ⚠️ Disclaimer:
Waypoints are generated based on your __**character’s position**__ — __not__ where your fishing float lands.
In ocean spots especially, the direction you cast your rod can place your float in a **different fishing zone**, which may result in catching the wrong type of fish.
This only happens in rare cases — when the position is right on the **edge of a zone** and you cast to the “wrong” side.

- To verify that your float you can use the guide [HERE](https://flockenberger.github.io/bdo-fish-position/)
- Or watch the guide [HERE](https://youtu.be/t-VXcRoNojk)
